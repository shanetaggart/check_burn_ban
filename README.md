# check_burn_ban

This simple web scraper was built in order to pull in the current Burn Ban information from https://novascotia.ca/burnsafe/.

A friend of mine wanted to know what the current Burn Ban conditions were, without having to remember to check the website every day. To solve this, the scraper was created to scrape the page and look for Burn Ban information for the town of your chosing, and to return that information in a format that would be able to work with his Smart Home integration.

At the time of creation, the Burn Ban information on the page was available, and the scraper was functional. At the time of writing this README, it is not functional as the page displays no Burn Ban information outside of the Mid-Spring to Mid-Fall months.
